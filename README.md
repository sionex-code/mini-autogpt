# Mini AutoGPT

Mini AutoGPT is a minimalist implementation of AutoGPT's foundational features, designed to provide a streamlined browsing experience. This project has the potential to become a larger-scale project with expanded functionality.

## Why Mini AutoGPT is Different

Mini AutoGPT is different from other web browsing automation tools because it doesn't require the OpenAI API to work. While it can work with GPT-3.5, the current accuracy is very low. However, Mini AutoGPT can work with the GPT-4 version, and it doesn't require any API or complex setup.

Note that the `chatgpt-unofficial-api.py` file needs to be run on a server for better performance.

## Features

- Browse Google with ease
- Visit websites with minimalistic code
- Efficient and user-friendly design
- Robust and reliable implementation
